# Decision Tree Learning

This repository contains a Python script for learning a decision tree using the LEARN-DECISION-TREE algorithm. The script utilizes the `scikit-learn` library to create a Decision Tree Classifier and visualizes the resulting decision tree.

## Repository Contents

* `decision_tree_learning.py`: The main Python script for learning a decision tree.
* `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the repository and instructions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the decision tree learning script:


Follow these steps to get started with the decision tree learning script:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abelxmendoza/Decision-Tree-Learning.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Repository:**

```bash
cd Decision-Tree-Learning
```

**3. Run the Script:**

```bash
python3 decision_tree_learning.py
```

This will execute the script, create a decision tree, and display a graphical representation of the tree.

## Visualization

The decision tree is visualized using the `plot_tree` function from `scikit-learn`. The graphical representation shows decision nodes, leaf nodes, and conditions based on features.

## Dataset

The script uses a simple dataset with binary input attributes (A1, A2, A3) and a binary output (Output y).
